# File System Module | fs

### Description

Generally fs module provides functions to work (<b>access & interact</b>) with file system.

In this small project, we've worked with fs module functions for creating directories, creating files and adding some data to it. <br>
We've also managed to listen those created files. <br>
At last we've renamed those files and appended some more data to it.

### Installing

Once you've cloned the project, on bash, inside the project directory, run the following command:

```
$ npm i
```

### Environment Variables

<b> Before executing the project, you should add a .env file based on .env.dist example to define customized name of folders & archives. In case you do not create it, the project is going to get default names. </b>

```
FOLDER_NAME
FIRST_FILE_NAME # Must start with "tsk_"
SECOND_FILE_NAME # Must start with "tsk_"
RENAME_FIRST_FILE # Must start with "tsk_"
RENAME_SECOND_FILE # Must start with "tsk_"
```

### Running Project

Once you've created .env file, to execute the chain described on the brief above, run the following command:

```
$ npm run project
```

### Doubts

Along the project development the major doubt was about <b>project structure</b>.<br>
I haven't had doubts about fs module functions at all.
